                    <h2>Variable Scope in JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of variable scope, namely:</p>
                    <div id="cls-video-container-5Dm6bvSz" class="adthrive" style="min-height: 463.5px;">
                        <div></div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="AdThrive_Content_1_desktop" class="adthrive-ad adthrive-content adthrive-content-1" style="min-height: 250px;">
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global Scope</li>
                        <li>Function Scope</li>
                        <li>Block Scope</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although, there used to be only two types of scopes before <strong>ES6</strong>, the global scope, and the local
                        scope. But, with ES6 local scope was broken down into function scope and block scope.</p>
                    <p>Let’s start with the global scope first.</p>
                    <h2>Global Scope</h2>
                    <p>The variables defined outside of any <strong>function</strong> or <strong>curly </strong>brackets are known as global
                        variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                        program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code block
                        will have access to those variables.</p>
                    <h2>Local Scope</h2>
                    <p>If you were to define some variables inside <strong>curly brackets {}</strong> or inside a specific function then
                        those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local
                        scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into two different scopes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Function scope</li>
                        <li>Block scope.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Function Scope</h2>
                    <p>The function scope is the accessibility of the variables defined inside a function, these variables cannot be
                        accessed from any other function or even outside the function in the main file. </p>
                    <div id="AdThrive_Content_3_desktop" class="adthrive-ad adthrive-content adthrive-content-3" style="min-height: 250px;">
                    </div>
                    <h2>Block Scope</h2>
                    <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside
                        the <strong>curly brackets {}</strong>. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                        something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the <strong>curly brackets {}</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: Differences between forEach() and map() methods:</b>


                    <p>The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array. The map() method creates an entirely new
                    array. The forEach() method returns “undefined“. The map() method returns the newly created array according to the
                    provided callback function.</p>

                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: Differences between filter() and find() methods:</b>

                    <p>The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not
                    match are removed. The only difference is the filter() method search through all the elements while find() method search
                    through all the child elements only</p>

                    <hr>
                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: benefits and reason using templates string:</b>


                    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables
                    and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create
                    strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags.
                    Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.</p>

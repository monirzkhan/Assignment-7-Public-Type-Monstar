                    <hr>
                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions.</b>
                    <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for
                    writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner,
                    there are certain differences between them.</p>

                    <p><b>1. Syntax:</b>
                    The arrow function example above allows a developer to accomplish the same result with fewer lines of code and
                    approximately half the typing.
                    
                    Curly brackets aren’t required if only one expression is present. The above example can also be written like this:</p>
                    <p><b>2. Arguments binding</b>
                    Arrow functions do not have an arguments binding. However, they have access to the arguments object of the closest
                    non-arrow parent function. Named and rest parameters are heavily relied upon to capture the arguments passed to arrow
                    functions.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Use of this keyword</b>
                    Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this. The value of this inside an arrow function remains
                    the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow
                    parent function.</p>
                    <p><b>4. Using new keyword</b>
                   
                    Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular
                    functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.
                    
                    However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
                    constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p>
                    <p><b>5. No duplicate named parameters</b>
                    Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.</p>

                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: Differences between forEach() and map() methods:</b>


                    <p>The forEach() method does not create a new array based on the given array. The map() method creates an entirely new
                    array. The forEach() method returns “undefined“. The map() method returns the newly created array according to the
                    provided callback function.</p>

                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: Differences between filter() and find() methods:</b>

                    <p>The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not
                    match are removed. The only difference is the filter() method search through all the elements while find() method search
                    through all the child elements only</p>

                    <hr>
                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: benefits and reason using templates string:</b>


                    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables
                    and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create
                    strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags.
                    Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.</p>

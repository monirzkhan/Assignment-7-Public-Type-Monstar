                    <h2>Variable Scope in JavaScript</h2>
                    <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of variable scope, namely:</p>
                    <div id="cls-video-container-5Dm6bvSz" class="adthrive" style="min-height: 463.5px;">
                        <div></div>
                    </div>
                    <div id="AdThrive_Content_1_desktop" class="adthrive-ad adthrive-content adthrive-content-1" style="min-height: 250px;">
                    </div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Global Scope</li>
                        <li>Function Scope</li>
                        <li>Block Scope</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although, there used to be only two types of scopes before <strong>ES6</strong>, the global scope, and the local
                        scope. But, with ES6 local scope was broken down into function scope and block scope.</p>
                    <p>Let’s start with the global scope first.</p>
                    <h2>Global Scope</h2>
                    <p>The variables defined outside of any <strong>function</strong> or <strong>curly </strong>brackets are known as global
                        variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that
                        program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is not a good practice to use global variables when they are not needed as every code block
                        will have access to those variables.</p>
                    <h2>Local Scope</h2>
                    <p>If you were to define some variables inside <strong>curly brackets {}</strong> or inside a specific function then
                        those variables are called local variables The local variables have a very confined scope which is called the local
                        scope But, with the release of ES6, the local scope was further broken down into two different scopes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Function scope</li>
                        <li>Block scope.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Function Scope</h2>
                    <p>The function scope is the accessibility of the variables defined inside a function, these variables cannot be
                        accessed from any other function or even outside the function in the main file. </p>
                    <div id="AdThrive_Content_3_desktop" class="adthrive-ad adthrive-content adthrive-content-3" style="min-height: 250px;">
                    </div>
                    <h2>Block Scope</h2>
                    <p>Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside
                        the <strong>curly brackets {}</strong>. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                        something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the <strong>curly brackets {}</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <hr>
                    

                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: How JavaScript Event Loop works:</b>

                    
                    <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to
                    the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If
                    there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</p>
                   
                    <h3>Javascript Web APIs:</h3>
                    <p>These are the additional functionality, that helps us perform some additional tasks which cannot be run using the
                        main thread. However, since our JavaScript runtime is single-threaded, it can export some tasks to the WEB APIs
                        which helps us to respond to multiple threads. Example of some web APIs are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>DOM </li>
                            <li>Ajax (Network requests)</li>
                            <li>setTimeout()</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>For instance, <code>setTimeout()</code> is called, the browser delegates the task to a different thread to calculate
                        the time interval specified in the argument of the <code>setTimeout()</code> method, and once done this tread would
                        then call the desired function in callback stack.</p>
                        <p>Since JavaScript is single-threaded, the browser has the capability of delegating the task in multiple threads. But
                            how does the event loop help in these executions? But now we are good to go ahead with Event Loop. </p>

                    <h3>Event Loop && Event Queue:</h3>
                    <p>Since we know that Web APIs delegate some of the tasks to different threads, on completion of these tasks, how the
                        main or desired functions are sent to the call stack. </p>
                        <p>Event Queue is a special queue, which keeps track of all the functions queues, which are needed to be pushed into the
                            call stack.
                            The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the track for processing. The queue data structure is
                            required to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution.</p>

                            <p>Let's take an example, in the following example, we are using a setTimeout function, which will log the "executed"
                            string after 2000 milliseconds.</p>

                        <pre class="grvsc-container dark-default-dark" data-language="javascript"
                            data-index="2"><code class="grvsc-code"><span class="grvsc-line"><span class="mtk1">  </span></span>
                        <span class="grvsc-line"><span class="mtk1">  </span><span class="mtk11">setTimeout</span><span class="mtk1">(</span><span class="mtk4">function</span><span class="mtk1">(){</span></span>
                        <span class="grvsc-line"><span class="mtk1">    </span><span class="mtk10">console</span><span class="mtk1">.</span><span class="mtk11">log</span><span class="mtk1">(</span><span class="mtk8">"Executed"</span><span class="mtk1">;)</span></span>
                        <span class="grvsc-line"><span class="mtk1">  }, </span><span class="mtk7">2000</span><span class="mtk1">);</span></span></code></pre>

                        <p>Now when a setTimeout operation is processed in the call stack. On its execution, it calls a web API which fires a timer
                        for 2000 milliseconds. After 2000 milliseconds has been elapsed, the web API, place the callback function of setTimeout
                        in the event queue.</p>

                        <p>Here need to mention that, just placing our function does not necessarily imply that the function will get executed.
                        This function has to be pushed into the call stack for execution and here the event loop comes into the picture. The
                        event loop waits for the function stack to be empty, once the call stack is empty this will push the first function from
                        the event queue to the call stack, and in this way, the desired function will be called.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <b class="text-success my-3">Answer: benefits and reason using templates string:</b>


                    <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables
                    and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create
                    strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags.
                    Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.</p>
